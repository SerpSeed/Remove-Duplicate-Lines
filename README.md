# Remove-Duplicate-Lines
Javascript for removing duplicate lines inside an HTML textarea. Includes CSS for styling. You will need to set the textarea, save, and load button IDs for the script to function properly.

Contains commented out code to display line numbers, but at a serious cost of performance on very large files.
